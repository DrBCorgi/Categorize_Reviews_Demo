Requirements
Python 3.x
Transformers: pip install transformers
Pandas: pip install pandas
Tkinter: typically included with Pythonâ€™s standard library
Instructions
Setup Your Environment:
Ensure you have Python installed and have installed the necessary libraries via pip.

Prepare Your Data:
Your input should be a CSV file where the text data for classification is present in a column named 'Review'.

Run the Script:
Execute the script by running python CategorizeReviews.py from your command line.

Select the Input File:

Upon execution, a file dialog will appear. Use it to select your CSV file containing the reviews.
Enter Categories:

A prompt will ask you to input the categories you want to classify your text into. Enter the categories separated by commas (e.g., "food, service, ambiance").
Review Classification:

The script will use a zero-shot classification model (facebook/bart-large-mnli) to categorize each review into the specified categories and calculate confidence scores for each category.
After processing, it will prompt you to save the output file. This output CSV file will include the original review data and new columns for each category with corresponding scores.
Save and Review the Results:

Choose a location and save the output CSV file. The script will then save the DataFrame to the new CSV file and print a confirmation message with the path to the saved file.
Open the output CSV file in any spreadsheet software to view the classification results.
Notes:
The zero-shot classification method allows the model to classify text into categories that were not present in the model's training data, making it versatile for various types of text data.
Ensure your input data is clean and well-formatted to avoid errors during processing.
